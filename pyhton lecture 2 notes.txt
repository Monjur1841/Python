I want to create a variable 
The variable will have a value 
hence there will be no remainder 
so return value is 0

We are trying to initiate a function in 
my_class. When we initiate the function 
it has to come from the function of 
my_class

any value that the variable assigned to
the function takes and is a postive boolean 
value hence the answer by logic is "yes"
If the value does not undertake any values 
then the answer is "no".
